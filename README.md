# WENDy
WENDy (Weak-form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics) is a forward solver-free algorithm for estimating parameters in differential equations. An article describing the method has been published:

Note that generation Figures 8-13 from the manuscript require large datasets which will be made available soon. Results from Figures 3-7 can be reproduced on a single-run basis by running wendy_script.m
