# WENDy
WENDy (Weak-form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics)  is a forward solver-free algorithm for estimating parameters in differential equations. A pre-print of the manuscript can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13271

Note that generation Figures 8-13 from the manuscript require large datasets which will be made available soon. Results from Figures 3-7 can be reproduced on a single-run basis by running wendy_script.m
